# Flappy Bird Game Remake

I used the Pygame module of Python to create the remake of a game called Flappy Bird. The player needs to control the bird to move through gaps between pipes, the player loses if the bird collides with the pipes or the ground. The player can make the bird fly upwards by pressing up key, if they do not do that, the bird would drop to the ground and therefore the player loses. The bird needs to fly through the pipes, flying through each pair of pipes worth one point and in the end, the player can replay the game by pressing the enter key.

create_task.py is the code of the game.
The other files are pictures that are used to make the game.
